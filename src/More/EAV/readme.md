# Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV)

- The EAV pattern in order to implement EAV model with PHP.

## Purpose:

- The EAV model is a data model to describe entities where the number of attributes
(properties, parameters) that can be used to describe them is potentially vast,
but the number that will actually apply to a given entity is relatively modest.
