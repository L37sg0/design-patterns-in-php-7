# Creational design patterns

- In Software engineering, creational design patterns are those that deal
with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in manner suitable
for the situation.
- The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added
complexity of the design.
- Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this
object creation.
