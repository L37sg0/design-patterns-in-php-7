# Singleton
# This is considered to be an anty-Pattern! For better Testability and maintainability use dependency injection!

## Purpose:

- To have only one instance of this object in the application that will handle
all calls.

###### [Examples:]

- DB Connector, Logger, Lock file for the application (there is only on in the
filesystem).
